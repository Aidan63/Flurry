This engine is currently WIP so nothing is set in stone or stable, this engine is made for my own needs and has no real documentation or tutorials outside the code so use at your own risk! It currently supports deskops through hxcpp with a OpenGL 3.3, OpenGL 4.6, and Direct3D 11.1 renderer. Once WebGPU is stable / release support for that will be added.

The engine is heavily inspired by the [luxe engine (haxe alpha version)](https://github.com/underscorediscovery/luxe) by Sven Bergstr√∂m with much of the terminology and code acting as the base or in many cases directly copied over. Anyone familiar with luxe will find flurry extremely familiar, most of the stuff I have changed and am planning to change is under the hood so the user api should say fairly similar to luxe.
